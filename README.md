Before someone confirms and merges this pull request, 
i'd be grateful if yall would take a look at it to make sure it is compatible! 
Everything works as intended on my device but as I found out many hours earlier 
that may not be the case for everyone else. I changed the login GUI to be an 
application window with the main method inside, and then the main GUi is a jframe still. 
I had to remake the files completely in order to be able to edit the gui aspects of them as well. 
I used most of the code already within those files.

The files for Login and MainPage are within the SRC folder!
